  Rules shall be received at any time.

    § 5. Special orders. Whenever any bill or other matter is made a  spe-
  cial  order  for a particular day, and it shall not be completed on that
  day, it shall, unless otherwise ordered, retain its place on the  calen-
  dar  as a special order in the order of business in which it was consid-
  ered. When a special order is under consideration, it shall take preced-
  ence  over  any special order for a subsequent hour of the same day; but
  such subsequent order may be taken up immediately after disposal of  the

    c. Except for bills reported from a standing committee and  placed  on
  that part of the calendar designated as "order of special report," bills
  reported  from  a standing committee shall be placed on the first report
  calendar and, unless starred, shall be  automatically  advanced  to  the
  second  report  part of the calendar after one calendar legislative day.
  Bills on second report shall, unless starred, be advanced to  the  order
  of  third reading after one calendar legislative day. No debate shall be
  allowed on the advancement of bills on the  order  of  first  or  second
  report  or  special  report. The order of special report shall be marked
  with an asterisk to indicate that such bills will be subject  to  debate
  on  the  next calendar legislative day. In the event that such bills are
  not debated on such day, they shall be removed from the order of special
  report and placed on that part of  the  calendar  designated  "bills  on
  order of first report".
 
    § 7. Executive Session. The Senate shall go into consideration of exe-
  cutive business at such times as may be ordered by a vote of the majori-
  ty  of the Senators present. On motion to close the doors of the Senate,

  tive session, the Presiding Officer shall direct all persons, except the
  Senators, the Counsel to the respective conferences,  Secretary  of  the

  Senate,  his or her messenger, the Journal Clerk and Sergeant at Arms of
  the Senate to withdraw; and during the discussion  of  said  motion  the
  doors  shall  remain  shut;  and every Senator and officer of the Senate
  shall  keep  secret all such matters, proceedings and things which shall
  transpire while the doors remain closed.
 
    § 8. Motions. a. When a question is before the Senate, only  the  fol-
  lowing  motions  shall be made by a Senator, and such motions shall have
  precedence in the order here stated, viz.:
 
    (1) For an adjournment.
 
    (2) For a call of the Senate.
 
    (3) For the previous question.
 
    (4) To lay on the table.
 
    (5) To postpone to a certain day.
 
    (6) To commit to a standing committee.
 
    (7) To commit to a select committee.
 
    (8) To change calendar arrangement.
 
    (9) To amend.
 
    b. The motion to adjourn, or for a call of the Senate, or for the pre-
  vious question, or to lay on the table, shall be decided without debate,
  and shall always be in order except as provided in Rules six, eight  and
  ten.
 
    c.  Except  for  the  motions  enumerated in subdivision a hereof, all
  other motions shall be reduced to writing, if desired by  the  Presiding
  Officer  or  any  five  Senators,  delivered  to the Secretary, and read
  before the same shall be debated; and any motion may be withdrawn at any
  time before decision or amendment.
 
    d. A motion for the previous question, or a motion to  postpone  to  a
  certain  day,  or to commit, or refer to a standing or select committee,
  until it is decided, shall preclude all debate of the main question.
 
    e. A motion for the previous question shall only be in order when made
  by the leaders of the respective  conferences  or  their  designee.  The
  "previous  question"  shall  be put as follows: "Shall the main question
  now be put before the house?" and until it is  decided,  shall  preclude
  all  amendments  or  debate.  When, on taking the previous question, the
  Senate shall decide that the main question shall now be  put,  the  main
  question shall be put to an immediate vote. When, on taking the previous
  question,  the  Senate shall decide that the main question shall not now
  be put, the main question shall be considered as still  remaining  under
  debate.  The  "main question" shall be the advancement or passage of the
  bill, resolution or other matter under consideration. Such motion  shall
  require the affirmative vote of a majority of the Senators elected.
 
    §  9.  Reconsideration.  a.  When  a  question  has  once been put and
  decided, it shall be in order for any Senator to move for the  reconsid-

  eration thereof; but no motion for the reconsideration of any vote shall
  be in order after the bill, resolution, message, report, amendment, nom-
  ination or motion, upon which the vote was taken, shall have gone out of
  the  possession  of the Senate; nor shall any motion for reconsideration
  be in order unless made on the same day on which the vote was taken,  or
  within the next three days of the actual session of the Senate thereaft-
  er.  Nor  shall  any question be reconsidered more than once; but when a
  bill or resolution shall have been recalled from the Assembly, a  motion
  for reconsideration may be made at any time thereafter while the same is
  in the possession of the Senate, and all resolutions recalling a bill or
  resolution  from  the  Assembly shall be regarded as privileged. No vote
  shall be reconsidered upon either of the following motions:
 
    To adjourn.
 
    To lay on the table.
 
    b. The vote on the final passage of any bill appropriating  moneys  or
  property, or creating, continuing, altering or removing any body politic
  or  corporate, shall not be reconsidered whenever any such bill shall be
  lost, unless by a vote of a majority of all the  Senators  elected,  but
  all other bills, when the same shall have been lost, may be reconsidered
  by a vote of a majority of all the Senators present and voting.

                                  RULE VII
 
  INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS
 
    Section  1. Introduction. Bills and resolutions shall be introduced by
  a Senator, or on the report of a  committee,  or  by  message  from  the
  Assembly,  or  by  order  of  the Senate, or by the Governor pursuant to
  Article VII of the Constitution.  Every  bill  introduced  shall  be  in
  duplicate  and  shall  have endorsed thereon a title and the name of the
  bill's sponsor and shall be accompanied by the  introducer's  memorandum
  in  quadruplicate. Such memorandum shall contain a statement of the pur-
  poses and intent of the bill and, if the member  deems  it  appropriate,
  may  set  forth  such  other  statements that the member feels necessary
  including, but not limited to, statements relating to  economic  impact,
  environmental impact or the impact on the judicial system of the bill. A
  Committee,  where  it deems necessary, may require that the introducer's
  memorandum be amended to include such appropriate statements.
 
    Bills introduced by Senators shall  be  deposited  with  the  Revision
  Clerk  for the purpose of having such clerk examine and correct bills to
  avoid repetition of introduction and ensure accuracy  in  the  text  and
  references. Upon introduction, each bill shall be deemed to have had its
  first  and second reading, unless otherwise ordered and shall be given a
  number and immediately referred to the appropriate standing committee by
  the Majority Coalition Leaders or an officer designated by the  Majority
  Coalition Leaders in accordance with a set of guidelines to be published
  annually  by the Majority Coalition Leaders setting forth the respective
  statutes over which each of the standing committees shall  have  subject
  matter  jurisdiction  for  purposes  of  referral.  Such referrals shall
  reflect the subject matter having predominance in the bill as determined
  by the Majority Coalition Leaders.
 
    § 2. Multi-sponsorship. Any Senator may join together  in  the  multi-
  sponsorship of a bill. If two or more Senators join together when a bill
  is  first  introduced  and before it is printed, the names of all multi-
  sponsors shall appear on the printed bill upon the following conditions:
 
    a. Multi-sponsors shall file a written request in duplicate to act  as
  such,  on  forms  provided,  with  the Revision Clerk of the Senate. The
  first name appearing on the bill shall be deemed the introducer and  all
  others deemed multi-sponsors.
 
    b.  The  introducer shall at all times retain exclusive control of the
  bill until formally acted upon by the Senate and any motion to discharge
  a bill out of committee by a member who is not  the  introducer  of  the
  bill shall be out of order.
 
    c.  After  a  multi-sponsored bill has been printed, any multi-sponsor
  desiring to withdraw from such multi-sponsorship shall  file  a  written
  request on a form provided so that his or her name will be stricken as a
  multi-sponsor  from the records of the Revision Clerk. The printed bill,
  however, shall not be reprinted.
 
    d. Senators and Senators-elect may multi-sponsor bills that have  been
  pre-filed  and  bills  introduced  after the opening of each legislative
  session upon the following conditions:

    (1) After a bill has been introduced and printed  and  before  it  has
  been  reported  favorably out of the Committee to which it was referred,
  any Senator or Senators may file with the Revision Clerk a request on  a
  form provided to become a multi-sponsor of such bill. Such forms must be
  signed by the multi-sponsor.
 
    (2)  Such bill shall not be reprinted solely for the purpose of adding
  or deleting names of multi-sponsors.
 
    (3) Any Senator, having become a multi-sponsor of a bill, may withdraw
  from such by filing a request on a form provided to the  Revision  Clerk
  requesting  that his or her name be stricken as a multi-sponsor from the
  record.
 
    (4) Any Senator who has become a multi-sponsor of a bill in the manner
  set forth herein shall have the right to distribute such bill bearing an
  endorsement by rubber stamp or otherwise the words "multi-sponsored  by"
  and insert his or her own name as multi-sponsor.
 
    §  3.  Printing. Every bill immediately upon its introduction shall be
  printed and placed on the bill files on the desks of the Senators, where
  it shall remain for at least three calendar legislative days. All  bills
  reported  favorably  or  for consideration, if reported with amendments,
  and all bills amended in  the  Senate,  shall  be  immediately  printed,
  except  that  any  bill  which  is amended by restoring it to an earlier
  form, shall not be required to be  printed  again,  and  thereafter  the
  printed  number of the bill in the form to which it has been so restored
  shall constitute the final form of such  bill  unless  further  amended.
  Whenever  a bill is amended and printed, a letter of the alphabet start-
  ing with "A" shall be added to its number.
 
    § 4. Title and body of bill. The title of  every  bill  shall  briefly
  state the subject thereof. The title of every bill amending or repealing
  any  provision  of a consolidated law shall refer to such law. The title
  of every bill amending or repealing any unconsolidated law  shall  refer
  to such law by its short title, if it has one; if it has no short title,
  the title of such bill shall state the chapter number, year of enactment
  and  the  complete  title of the original bill or a short summary of the
  provisions to which the law relates. If such bill is amending or repeal-
  ing a proposed provision of law contained in a bill that  has  not  been
  enacted  into law, the title shall state the number of the bill contain-
  ing the proposed provision of law to be amended or repealed,  with  suf-
  fix,  if  there  be  one, and the subject of the provisions to which the
  amendatory bill relates. No private or local bill may  be  passed  which
  shall  embrace  more  than  one  subject which shall be expressed in the
  title.
 
    a. In any bill, each section proposing an amendment to or  the  repeal
  of:  (i)  any  consolidated law, or any part thereof; or (ii) the Family
  Court Act, the Court of Claims Act, the Uniform District Court Act,  the
  Uniform Justice Court Act, the Uniform City Court Act, the New York City
  Charter,  the  Administrative Code of the City of New York, the New York
  City Civil Court Act, the New York City Criminal Court Act, or the Char-
  ter of the City of Buffalo, or any part thereof shall refer to such law,
  act, charter or code. In any bill, each section proposing  an  amendment
  to  or  the repeal of an unconsolidated law having a short title, or any
  part thereof, shall refer to such law by its chapter number and year  of
  enactment  and  its  short title. If an unconsolidated law shall have no

  short title, each section shall state the chapter  number  and  year  of
  enactment  of  such  law, and a short summary of the provisions to which
  the law relates or the complete title of the original bill. If such sec-
  tion  amends  or repeals a proposed provision of law contained in a bill
  that has not been enacted into law, each section shall state the  number
  of  the bill containing such proposed provisions of law to be amended or
  repealed, with suffix, if there be one. If the portion of the  law  pro-
  posed to be amended has been added, renumbered or amended since the ori-
  ginal  enactment  or  last  general revision of the law of which it is a
  part, such section shall also state the chapter number and year  of  the
  last  act  adding, renumbering or amending the same, as the case may be.
  There shall be appended at the end of  every  bill  which  proposes  the
  repeal or extension of any existing law, or part thereof, merely by ref-
  erence  thereto,  without setting forth the text thereof, an explanatory
  note which shall briefly and concisely state the subject matter  of  the
  law,  or  part thereof, proposed to be repealed or extended, unless such
  subject matter is stated in the title of such bill. The  Revision  Clerk
  of  the Senate shall return any bill to the Senator introducing the same
  when it is called to his or her attention that the  provisions  of  this
  section, or of section one of this Rule, have not been complied with, or
  when any copy of a bill is illegible or incomplete.
 
    b.  Every bill when introduced, and every amendment thereafter made to
  such bill amending existing law, must have all new  matter  underscored,
  and  all matter eliminated by amendment from existing law must appear in
  its proper place enclosed in brackets. In the printed bill such new mat-
  ter shall be underscored and all matter  eliminated  by  amendment  from
  existing  law shall be enclosed in black-faced brackets. When any exist-
  ing law or part thereof is proposed to be repealed by a bill,  the  word
  "repealed"  as  it  appears  in such bill shall be printed in bold-faced
  type. When a printed bill is amended by eliminating new matter from such
  bill, the same shall be omitted in the reprint  of  the  original.  When
  amendments are offered to a printed bill, the proposed changes, indicat-
  ing page and line numbers, shall be listed on four detail sheets and the
  same changes shall be incorporated and marked on two copies of the bill;
  provided,  however, that no amendment shall be allowed to any bill which
  is not germane to the original object or purpose  thereof.  Furthermore,
  when a printed bill is amended the accompanying introducer's memorandum,
  required  pursuant to section one of this Rule, shall also be amended to
  reflect any changes. It shall be the duty of the Secretary to direct the
  Revision Clerk to cause any bill appearing on the calendar and not  com-
  plying  with this section to be immediately amended and printed so as to
  comply with the same.
 
    § 5. Final date. a. The Majority Coalition  Leaders  may  designate  a
  date  in  writing  after  which  no bill or original resolution shall be
  introduced except by message from the Assembly, but no date prior to the
  first Tuesday of March shall be so designated; provided,  however,  that
  all  bills recommended by a State department or agency must be submitted
  to the office of the Temporary President not later than the first day of
  March. Bills proposed by the Governor, the Attorney General,  the  Comp-
  troller,  the  Department  of  Education or the Office of Court Adminis-
  tration must be submitted to the office of the  Temporary  President  no
  later than the first Tuesday in April.
 
    b.  All bills introduced in the Senate after the second Friday in June
  shall be introduced to the Committee on Rules.

    § 6. Budget bills. When a bill is submitted or proposed by the  Gover-
  nor  by  authority  of Article VII of the Constitution, it shall become,
  for all legislative purposes, a legislative bill, and upon receipt ther-
  eof by the Senate it shall be endorsed "Budget Bill" and be given a num-
  ber  by the Secretary and shall be referred to the Finance Committee and
  be printed.  Budget bills may be reported  from  the  Finance  Committee
  direct to the third reading calendar.
 
    §  7.  Program,  departmental and agency bills. Every bill proposed by
  the Governor, the Attorney General, the Comptroller or by state  depart-
  ments  and  agencies  shall  be submitted to the office of the Temporary
  President and shall be forwarded by the Majority Coalition  Leaders  for
  introduction  purposes  to the appropriate standing committee in accord-
  ance with section one of Rule VII. Any such bill which is  not  so  for-
  warded  within  three weeks after receipt by the office of the Temporary
  President shall be offered to the Democratic Conference Leader  who  may
  in  accordance  with  section one of Rule VII, forward such bills to any
  member for introduction purposes.
 
    § 8. Reintroduction. Any Senate bill introduced in the first  year  of
  the term of the Senate which during that regular Legislative Session was
  not  reported  from a Standing Committee or if reported and later recom-
  mitted to a Standing Committee is deemed to  be  automatically  reintro-
  duced  for  the  second  year of the term of the Senate. All bills which
  remain on the calendar at the end of the first year of the term  of  the
  Senate shall be recommitted to committee.
 
    §  9.  Resolutions. a. All original resolutions shall be in quadrupli-
  cate, and no original resolution may be introduced unless copies thereof
  first shall have been furnished, to the extent practicable,  forty-eight
  hours prior to the time for acting on such resolution to respective con-
  ference  leaders.  All resolutions, upon introduction, shall be referred
  to a standing or select committee by the Majority Coalition  Leaders  or
  an officer designated by the Majority Coalition Leaders and shall at all
  times  remain  within  the exclusive control of the introducer. Notwith-
  standing any of the foregoing provisions of  this  section,  resolutions
  recalling  bills from or returning bills to the Assembly, or relating to
  adjournment, may be introduced at any time for immediate consideration.
 
    b. A resolution supporting or condemning, or  proposing  or  urging  a
  change  in  Federal  law  which  is not directly germane to the affairs,
  business, rights, benefits and obligations of New York  State  shall  be
  out  of order and shall not be reported and any resolution recommending,
  urging, supporting, altering or condemning a position or change in  for-
  eign  policy  of the United States Government or the domestic or foreign
  affairs of any other government of the World shall be out of  order  and
  shall not be reported.  Any resolution which recommends, urges, supports
  the  alteration  of the laws of this state, resolutions which honor cur-
  rent elected office holders or resolutions  which  recognize,  honor  or
  support  the  positions  of  a political party shall be out of order and
  shall not be reported.
 
    c. All resolutions which propose any amendment to the State  Constitu-
  tion  shall  be  referred to the Attorney General as provided in Article
  XIX of the Constitution, and shall be treated in the same form  of  pro-
  ceedings  as  that  provided for bills; and resolutions which ratify any
  proposed amendment to the Constitution of the  United  States  shall  be
  treated  in  the same form of proceedings as provided for bills. After a

  resolution to amend the State Constitution shall be  advanced  to  third
  reading, no motion to amend the same shall be in order without unanimous
  consent; and if such resolution to amend the State Constitution shall be
  amended  after  the  opinion  of  the  Attorney General thereon has been
  received as provided in Article XIX of the Constitution, it shall  again
  be  referred to the Attorney General. Any such resolution may be commit-
  ted prior to the final reading thereof.
 
    d. All resolutions calling for  the  expenditure  of  moneys  must  be
  decided  by a majority vote of all of the members elected to the Senate,
  upon a call of the roll.
 
    e. All resolutions deemed proper by  the  Majority  Coalition  Leaders
  other  than  those mentioned and treated in the preceding subdivisions c
  and d of this section and reported by the committee of reference  desig-
  nated  by the Majority Coalition Leaders shall be placed upon the calen-
  dar upon the approval of the Majority Coalition Leaders.   When  in  the
  order of business the resolutions are reached, the Senate may adopt such
  resolutions as a group, by one vote upon the question of the entire cal-
  endar  of resolution, excepting that any member may request that any one
  or more of the resolutions on such  calendar  shall  be  voted  upon  or
  debated  separately.  This subdivision shall not apply to any resolution
  recalling bills from or returning bills to the Assembly, or relating  to
  adjournment  or  to resolutions pertaining to the rules of the Senate or
  to those resolutions regarded as privileged.    A  resolution  shall  be
  deemed  privileged only if it is so designated by the Majority Coalition
  Leaders as such.

  ity Coalition and Democratic Conference members in the Senate  bears  to
  the total membership of the Senate.
 
    For  purposes  of committee composition, in the event that the propor-
  tion of Majority Coalition members would result in a fractional  amount,
  the number of Majority Coalition members shall be rounded up to the next

  whole  number.   Furthermore, the total number of Independent Democratic
  Conference members appointed to all committees shall be in the same pro-
  portion, as nearly as may be, as the number of  Independence  Democratic
  Conference  members  in  the Senate bears to the total membership of the

  ber on either the Finance or the Rules Committee, the Conference Leaders
  may designate an alternate member of  the  conference  for  meetings  of
  standing  committees provided written notice is provided and accepted by
  the Majority Coalition Leaders at least one hour prior to the  commence-
  ment of such committee meeting.
 
    d.  The  provisions of the opening paragraph of this section and para-
  graph c of this section relative to the proportional membership on  com-
  mittees  as well as the specific number of members to comprise each com-
  mittee may be amended by resolution adopted by  a  majority  of  members
  elected.
 
    §  2.  Committee  on Rules. The Committee on Rules may sit at any time
  and shall report bills out of committee only if  they  shall  have  been
  duly  reported  to  the  Committee on Rules from a standing committee of
  origin, or from a committee of secondary reference, or if the  chair  of
  such  standing  committee  consents,  or if the bill was referred to the
  Committee on Rules upon introduction. Other than a  motion  to  hold,  a
  motion  to discharge, or a motion to report, no other motion shall be in
  order in the Committee on Rules without the  consent  of  the  Committee
  Chair.  The reception and consideration of its report shall always be in
  order; debate on its adoption shall not exceed one and one  half  hours,
  one-half  hour for each conference, such time to be allotted by the Con-
  ference Leaders; and no other motion, except a motion by  the  Temporary
  President for a call of the Senate, to adjourn or to recess, shall be in
  order  until  the  vote  of the Senate is had thereon.  If the report be
  adopted, all inconsistent rules of the  Senate  shall  automatically  be
  suspended until the subject of such report has been disposed of, includ-
  ing final action thereon.
 
    §  3. Open Meetings of Standing Committees. a. (1) Standing committees
  shall hold regular meetings at such time and on such day as the Majority
  Coalition Leaders in consultation with the chair and such schedule shall
  be published one week in advance of the date of such meeting  and  shall
  be  posted  on the Senate committee board. The attendance of the members
  of the committee shall be recorded at each meeting, and a copy  of  such
  report  shall  be  filed  with  the Journal Clerk of the Senate and made
  available to the public. Each chair of a standing committee shall to the
  extent practicable, no later than 3 p.m. the Thursday preceding the reg-
  ular meeting, furnish to the Conference Leaders, and make  available  to
  each  member  of  such  committee,  a copy of the agenda of such regular
  meeting together with a copy of the  introducer's  memorandum  for  each
  bill listed on such agenda for such regular meeting. In addition, copies
  of  such agenda for such regular meeting shall be made available to rep-
  resentatives of the news media and to the general  public.  However,  in
  case of necessity, the chair with consent of the ranking Democratic Con-
  ference  member  may add no more than four items on the agenda or delete
  items on the agenda up to 24 hours in advance of the  scheduled  meeting
  and  members  shall  be  notified  of  such additions or deletions. Each
  standing committee chair shall decide all procedural issues which  arise
  during meetings of standing committees.

    (2) Standing committees may hold special meetings in case of necessity
  upon  the call of the chair when the announcement is made from the floor
  during session, or the ranking Democratic Conference member of the  com-
  mittee  consents thereto, or upon the call of a majority of all the mem-
  bers  thereof,  entry  of which fact shall be made on the records of the
  committee and announced by the Secretary of the Senate.
 
    (3) All meetings of committees shall be open to  authorized  represen-
  tatives of the news media and the general public as observers.
 
    (4)  All  meetings of committees shall be recorded by video and to the
  extent practicable webcast live. Video of all committee  meetings  shall
  be made available on the Senate website and updated daily.
 
    (5)  Upon the personal vote of a majority of all the members of a com-
  mittee, taken in an open meeting pursuant to a  motion  identifying  the
  general  area  or  areas  of the subject or subjects to be considered, a
  committee may conduct an executive session of which only members of such
  committee are present for the following  enunciated  purposes  provided,
  however,  that  no  action  by formal vote shall be taken to appropriate
  public monies:
 
    (a) matters which will imperil the public safety if disclosed;
 
    (b) any matter which may disclose the identity of  a  law  enforcement
  agent or informer;
 
    (c)  information relating to current or future investigation or prose-
  cution of a criminal offense which would imperil effective law  enforce-
  ment if disclosed;
 
    (d) discussions regarding proposed, pending or current litigation;
 
    (e)  collective negotiations pursuant to article fourteen of the Civil
  Service Law;
 
    (f) the medical, financial, credit, character or employment history of
  any person or  corporation,  or  matters  leading  to  the  appointment,
  employment,  promotion,  demotion,  discipline, suspension, dismissal or
  removal of any person or corporation;
 
    (g) the preparation, grading or administration of examinations; and
 
    (h) the proposed acquisition, sale or lease of real property, but only
  when publicity would substantially affect the value of the property.
 
    (6) Attendance at an executive session shall be permitted to any  mem-
  ber of the committee and any other persons authorized by the committee.
 
    b. (1) Minutes shall be taken at all open meetings of committees which
  shall  consist  of a record or summary of all motions, proposals, resol-
  utions and any other matter formally voted upon and the vote thereon.
 
    (2) Minutes shall be taken at executive sessions of any action that is
  taken by formal vote which shall consist of a record or summary  of  the
  final  determination of such action, and the date and vote thereon; pro-
  vided, however, that such summary shall not include any matter which  is

  not  required  to  be made public by "the freedom of information law" as
  added by Article six of the Public Officers Law.
 
    (3)  Minutes  of  meetings of all committees shall be available to the
  public in accordance with the provisions of Article six  of  the  Public
  Officers  Law,  "the  freedom  of information law", and at such time and
  place as prescribed by the Majority Coalition Leaders, provided,  howev-
  er,  that  minutes  for executive session meetings shall be available to
  the public within one week from the date of such executive session.
 
    c. The provisions of this section except paragraph three  of  subdivi-
  sion a, and subdivision b shall not apply to the Committee on Rules.
 
    d. Committee presentations. The chair of a committee may invite inter-
  ested  persons  to  offer a presentation for a given amount of time on a
  bill on the meeting agenda with notice provided to the ranking Democrat-
  ic Conference member no less than 72 hours in advance. Where a committee
  chair makes such an invitation, the ranking member shall be afforded  an
  equal  number  of speakers who may speak for an equal amount of time. In
  addition, the ranker, without consent of the chair,  shall  be  able  to
  schedule  3 committee presentations with notice provided to the chair at
  least 72 hours in advance. The chair shall be afforded an  equal  number
  of speakers who may speak for an equal amount of time.
 
    e. Motion for committee consideration. No motion for committee consid-
  eration  shall be in order after the first Monday in May.  In the course
  of a session year the sponsor of any bill may file, through the  Journal
  Clerk,  no  more  than  three  motions for committee consideration. Such
  motions shall be in order forty-five days after a bill has been referred
  to such committee. Once a motion for committee consideration  is  filed,
  the  chair  of  the committee shall place the bill on a committee agenda
  and schedule a vote on the bill within forty-five days,  if  the  forty-
  five  days shall expire while the senate is in recess, the bill shall be
  placed on the next regularly scheduled committee meeting's  agenda  fol-
  lowing the end of the forty-five day period.  In the case of a bill that
  is referred to a standing committee having secondary reference, the bill
  shall be considered within the next two committee meetings.
 
    §  4.  Hearings.  a. Committee hearings. Chairs of standing committees
  may call public hearings to permit interested persons, groups or  organ-
  izations  the opportunity to testify orally or in writing on legislation
  or issues pending before such standing committee. Chairs are  encouraged
  to  hold  public  hearings  on legislation of important public interest,
  where, outside of the budget, significant  public  money  is  allocated,
  broad  conduct  is  regulated  or  where the proposal has a broad public
  impact. Chairs may request that the Official Stenographer make a  steno-
  graphic  record  of a public hearing. Official hearings may be conducted
  in accordance with procedure established by law. No committee  may  take
  testimony at a hearing unless at least two of its members are present at
  such  hearing. Prior notice of all public hearings shall be filed by the
  chair or his or her designee with The Legislative Bill Drafting  Commis-
  sion  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Senate and such notice shall contain
  information as to subject matter, date and place.
 
    b. Public forums. Notwithstanding the  public  hearings  conducted  by
  standing  committees, any Senator may convene a public forum on proposed
  or pending legislation within the jurisdiction of a committee upon which
  he or she is a member, provided that any charge  incurred  attendant  to

  such  forum  be  borne  by  said Senator or his or her party conference.
  Prior notice of such forum shall be filed with the chair of the  commit-
  tee.
 
    c.  Committee  oversight function. Each standing committee is required
  to conduct oversight of the administration of laws and programs by agen-
  cies within its jurisdiction.
 
    d. Each standing committee is required to file with the  secretary  of
  the  senate  an  annual  report, detailing its legislative and oversight
  activities. Such report shall be posted to the Senate web site.
 
    e. Petition for a public hearing on a bill. By a petition of one-third
  of the members assigned to a committee rounded up to the  nearest  whole
  number, a public hearing shall be scheduled on a specific bill or number
  of  bills within the jurisdiction of a committee, unless the majority of
  members of the committee reject such petition. Such petitions  shall  be
  submitted on the proper form to the Senate Desk for Operations, who will
  forward  it  to  the appropriate committee, for presentation at the next
  committee meeting. Such public hearings shall be held if they  meet  the
  guidelines  as  promulgated  by  the Majority Coalition Leaders.  Public
  hearings scheduled by petition will be held at least 14  days  following
  the committee meeting at which the petition was considered.
 
    f.  Hearings of standing committees shall be video recorded and to the
  extent practicable webcast live. Video of such hearing shall  be  posted
  to the Senate web site within 24 hours.
 
    §  5.  Reports.  a.  No committee shall vote to report a bill or other
  matter unless a majority of all the members thereof  vote  in  favor  of
  such  report. Each report of a committee upon a bill shall have the vote
  of each Senator attached thereto and  such  report  and  vote  shall  be
  available  for  public  inspection. A member's vote on any matter before
  the committee shall be entered by the member on a signed official voting
  sheet delivered to the Committee Chair.
 
    Any standing committee having secondary  subject  matter  jurisdiction
  over  a  bill may request the chair of the committee having primary sub-
  ject matter jurisdiction over said bill (which is the committee to which
  the said bill has been referred by the Majority Coalition Leaders pursu-
  ant to Rule VII) to commit the bill to the committee with secondary sub-
  ject matter jurisdiction either when the bill is still  in  the  primary
  committee or after it has been reported to the calendar. If the chair of
  the  primary  committee  refuses said request, then the committee having
  secondary jurisdiction, through its  chair,  may  request  the  Majority
  Coalition Leaders to consider such secondary referencing. If a secondary
  reference  is  so  made, the secondary committee shall consider the bill
  forthwith and return said bill to the primary committee or the calendar,
  as the case may be, along with  the  secondary  committee's  recommenda-
  tions.
 
    All  committee reports, after the second Friday in June, shall be made
  directly to the Committee on Rules.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  of
  Rule  VII,  the Committee on Rules shall have the authority to introduce
  and refer bills to itself and shall also have the authority to refer  to
  itself any bill from any standing committee.

    Every  report of a committee upon a bill which shall not be considered
  at the time of making the same, or laid on the table by a  vote  of  the
  Senate,  shall stand upon the calendar in the order of first report with
  the bill and be entered upon the journal.
 
    b.  Each bill reported by a standing committee shall be accompanied by
  a report, and the Democratic Conference shall file a Democratic  Confer-
  ence  committee  report within seven days of the bill being reported out
  of committee and said reports shall be filed with the journal clerk. The
  report of a committee upon any matter referred to it shall upon  request
  include a brief statement of the opinion of any member or members of the
  committee voting in either the majority or minority.
 
    c.  Where a "home rule" request is required as provided in any section
  of Article IX of the Constitution, such request, certificate or  message
  must  be filed with the Journal Clerk of the Senate before final passage
  of such bill.
 
    d. Where a message of necessity is received from  the  Governor,  such
  message  shall  be filed with the Journal Clerk of the Senate upon final
  passage of the bill.
 
    § 6. Nominations. Unless the Senate orders otherwise, all  nominations
  sent by the Governor for the appointment of any officer shall be submit-
  ted  to  the  Temporary  President who shall then refer such nominations
  simultaneously to the Finance Committee, and  the  appropriate  standing
  committee,  for  consideration and recommendation and such standing com-
  mittees, other than the Committee on Judiciary  shall  thereafter  refer
  such  nominations  to the Finance Committee of the Senate who shall take
  whatever further actions it deems  necessary  and  thereafter  make  its
  report  on  the nominations to the full Senate. Any Senator may submit a
  request to the Chair of a Standing Committee considering  a  nomination,
  to speak before the committee for not more than five minutes on the nom-
  ination.  The  granting  of  any  such request shall be at the sole dis-
  cretion of the Committee Chair. A  nomination  shall  not  be  confirmed
  without reference on the day on which it is received except by unanimous
  consent.  The names of those who voted for or against the nomination may
  be entered alphabetically on the journal, if any five  Senators  request
  it.
 
    §  7.  Finance Committee. A bill or resolution providing for an appro-
  priation or creating or increasing a  charge  upon  the  State  Treasury
  shall,  when reported by any committee other than the Finance Committee,
  be referred to the Finance Committee, and the committee  reporting  such
  bill  or  resolution shall, at the time of making such report, recommend
  the further reference thereof to the Finance Committee. At  the  request
  of the Majority Coalition Leaders or the Chair of the Finance Committee,
  any  such  bill or resolution shall, at any time before final reading or
  adoption, be referred to the Finance Committee, which may  consider  and
  report  upon any features in the bill or resolution creating or increas-
  ing such charge.
 
    The sponsor of a bill providing for an increase or decrease  in  state
  revenues or in the appropriation or expenditure of state moneys, without
  stating  the amount thereof, must, before such bill is reported from the
  Finance Committee or other committee to which referred,  file  with  the
  Finance  Committee  and  such  other committee a fiscal note which shall
  state, so far as possible, the amount in dollars whereby such state mon-

  eys, revenues or appropriations would be affected by such bill, together
  with a similar estimate, if the same  is  possible,  for  future  fiscal
  years. Such an estimate must be secured by the sponsor from the Division
  of  the  Budget  or the department or agency of state government charged
  with the fiscal duties, functions or powers provided in  such  bill  and
  the name of such department or agency must be stated in such note.
 
    The  Finance  Committee  shall keep and maintain a file containing all
  bills requiring fiscal notes and the notes appertaining  thereto,  which
  shall  be  available  to Senators and officers of the Senate, accredited
  representatives of the press, and other  responsible  persons  having  a
  legitimate interest therein.
 
    §  8. New York City Education Subcommittee. The Committee on education
  shall have a permanent subcommittee, consisting of six members,  on  New
  York  City  Education. The chairperson, ranking member and membership of
  the New York City Education  subcommittee  shall  be  appointed  by  the
  Majority  Coalition  Leaders with the ranking member and Democratic Con-
  ference members to be appointed upon the recommendation of the Democrat-
  ic Conference Leader.  Any bill referenced to  the  Education  Committee
  whose  subject  matter shall solely impact education matters in New York
  City shall be referenced by the committee to the New York City Education
  subcommittee. The New York City Education subcommittee shall be  subject
  to  the same rules and procedures as standing committees with the excep-
  tion that all bills reported from the New York City Education subcommit-
  tee will be reported to the Education Committee for further  action.  In
  no  instance may a bill reported out of the New York City Education sub-
  committee bypass the full consideration of the Education  Committee  and
  be reported directly to the calendar.

                                   RULE IX
 
  PASSAGE OF BILLS
 
    Section  1.  Bills  on  desks. No bill shall be passed unless it shall
  have been printed and upon the desk of each Senator in its final form at
  least three calendar legislative days prior to its final passage, unless
  the Governor or acting Governor shall have certified, under his  or  her
  hand  and  the  seal of the State, the facts which in his or her opinion
  necessitate an immediate vote thereon, in which case it  must  neverthe-
  less  be  upon  the desks of all Senators in final form, not necessarily
  printed, before its final passage. No bill shall be passed pursuant to a
  message of necessity unless a majority of the Senators vote  to  approve
  the use of such message.
 
    § 2. Reading of bills. a. Every bill shall receive three readings pre-
  vious to its being passed.
 
    b.  Upon the third reading of a bill, the question upon its final pas-
  sage shall be taken immediately thereafter; provided, however, that  any
  bill may be committed prior to the final reading thereof.
 
    §  3. Third reading calendar. a. The Calendar of bills on the order of
  third reading shall consist of all bills which have been advanced  to  a
  third  reading  from  the order of second report or the order of special
  report.
 
    b. All Senate bills,  when  advanced  to  a  third  reading  shall  be
  referred automatically to the Jacketing Clerk, who shall cause each such
  bill to be readied for final passage in the same form as the last print-
  ed  copy thereof. All such bills shall be jacketed with the proper jurat
  for certification of final passage attached.
 
    § 4. Amendments. a. A non-sponsor may move to amend a bill at any time
  prior to the completion of its third reading provided that at least  two
  hours  before the time for the Senate to convene, a copy of the proposed
  amendment or amendments to any bill on the list of bills compiled  under
  subdivision a of section six of this Rule has been served upon the spon-
  sor of the bill, and filed with the Journal Clerk. If a sponsor does not
  accept  such amendment, the question shall be put to the house whether a
  majority of members elected vote in favor of the non-sponsor  motion  to
  amend,  and such motion shall pass only if a majority of members elected
  vote aye. If the sponsor accepts the amendment, such amended bill  shall
  be  ordered printed without a vote, debate or explanation, and such bill
  shall retain its place on the Third Reading Calendar.
 
    b. If a majority of members elected vote in favor of  the  non-sponsor
  motion  to  amend, the sponsor of the bill may make a motion to withdraw
  their name from sponsorship to be substituted by  a  co-sponsor  or  the
  Senator who moved to amend the bill.
 
    c.  The  introducer  of  any  calendar  bill may offer an amendment or
  amendments to such bill  and  such  amendment  or  amendments  shall  be
  accepted and the bill ordered printed without a vote, debate or explana-
  tion,  provided, however, that in such case such bill may be recommitted
  by the chair of the standing committee that reported such bill and  such
  recommittal shall also be without a vote, debate or explanation.

    §  5.  Substitution.  When  a  bill  is received as a message from the
  Assembly, or at any time thereafter, and a Senate bill, identical there-
  with, is on the order of third reading, or in the order of first or sec-
  ond report, the Assembly bill may be substituted  for  the  Senate  bill
  upon  a vote of a majority of the Senate. A motion for such substitution
  shall be in order under the order  of  business  of  messages  from  the
  Assembly, motions and resolutions, or the order of business in which the
  Senate bill is.
 
    §  6. Final passage. a. Prior to the reading of the third reading cal-
  endar of any given day, the Majority Coalition Leaders may jointly  file
  with the Journal Clerk an active list of bills on the third reading cal-
  endar  which  may be acted upon on that date and he or she may lay aside
  any bill upon which no final action may be taken, provided however, that
  no bill shall be so laid aside for a period exceeding five calendar leg-
  islative days. Such active list shall be published to the extent practi-
  cable by 8 p.m. the previous evening or within two hours  following  the
  end of the previous days' session, whichever is later.
 
    b.  The  question  on  the  final passage of every bill shall be taken
  immediately after the third reading and without  debate.  On  the  final
  passage  of  every bill and concurrent resolution a fast roll call shall
  be taken by the Secretary calling the names of five Senators,  three  of
  whom  shall  be the Conference Leaders provided, however, that each Sen-
  ator's name shall be called on a slow roll call  if  requested  by  five
  Senators.  Each  roll call, including the names of the Senators who were
  absent shall be entered on the journal. Upon each roll  call  vote,  the
  Secretary  shall  announce the names of the Senators voting in the nega-
  tive and the names of the Senators who  were  absent.  Such  roll  calls
  shall  be  available for public inspection upon request in the office of
  the Journal Clerk. When a bill or concurrent resolution does not receive
  the number of votes required by the Constitution to pass it, it shall be
  declared lost, except in cases provided for by subdivision d of  section
  two of Rule X hereof.
 
    §  7.  Starred  bills.  a.  A  bill  appearing  on the calendar may be
  "starred" only by or on behalf of the introducer, whereupon all  further
  action on such bill shall be suspended, although it retains its place on
  the Calendar.
 
    b.  Other  than for the purpose of amendment or recommittal, no action
  may be taken on a bill from which a star has been removed until one  day
  after such removal.
 
    § 8. Recall and concurrence. All Senate bills amended by the Assembly,
  and  returned  to the Senate, for its concurrence, and all bills amended
  by the report of a conference committee, shall be subject  to  the  pro-
  visions of section one of this Rule.
 
    §  9. Transmittal of bills to the Governor. All Senate bills passed by
  the Senate and sent to the Assembly for action shall, upon  passage  and
  return by the Assembly to the Senate, be transmitted by the Secretary to
  the  Governor  within  forty-five  days after receipt from the Assembly;
  except that upon the filing of a request to hold such bill with the Sec-
  retary by the sponsor of the bill, the bill shall  be  held  until  such
  time  as the sponsor rescinds the request to hold the bill and upon such
  rescission the Secretary shall transmit the bill to the Governor  within
  seven days.

                                   RULE X
 
  SENATORS
 
    Section  1.  Attendance  and  vote.  a. Every Senator shall be present
  within the Senate Chamber during the sessions of the Senate, unless duly
  excused or necessarily prevented, and shall vote on  each  question  for
  which  a  vote  is  required stated from the Chair unless excused by the
  Senate, or unless he or she has a direct personal or pecuniary  interest
  in the event of such question. If any Senator refuses to vote, unless he
  or she be excused by the Senate, or unless he or she be interested, such
  refusal  shall  be  deemed a contempt. In order to vote on a bill on the
  controversial calendar, a Senator, other than  the  Conference  Leaders,
  must be present in the Senate chamber and vote from his or her regularly
  assigned  seat,  except  that a Senator acting as the Presiding Officer,
  Temporary President  or  Conference  Leader  may  vote  from  the  place
  assigned  to such officer. No Senator absent from a roll call vote shall
  be allowed to vote thereon; however, within  the  same  day,  a  Senator
  required  to  attend  a public hearing or other meeting of a standing or
  conference committee, or any other meeting which the Majority  Coalition
  Leaders  designate  as appropriate, may cast his or her vote at any time
  prior to 5:00 P.M. or the adjournment of the Senate, whichever shall  be
  later.
 
    b.  A Senator desiring to be excused from voting for a direct personal
  or pecuniary interest in the issue then before the Senate may, when  his
  or  her  name  is called, state such desire and if there be an objection
  make a brief statement, not occupying over two minutes, of  the  reasons
  for  making  such request, and the question on excusing him or her shall
  then be taken without debate and shall be granted by the consent of two-
  thirds of the Senators present; and any Senator desiring to explain  his
  or her vote upon a bill, may, when his or her name is called, be allowed
  a like opportunity.
 
    §  2.  Quorum. a. A majority of all the Senators elected shall consti-
  tute a quorum to do business. In case a less number than a quorum of the
  Senate shall convene, those present are authorized to send the  Sergeant
  at Arms, or any other person, for the absent Senators.
 
    b. The assent of two-thirds of the Senators elected shall be requisite
  to  every  bill appropriating the public moneys or property for local or
  private purposes, and to the passage of bills returned by  the  Governor
  without his or her approval.
 
    c.  On  the  final  passage  of  any  bill which imposes, continues or
  revives a tax, or creates a debt  or  charge,  or  makes,  continues  or
  revives  any  appropriation  of  public  or  trust money or property, or
  releases, discharges or commutes any  claim  or  demand  of  the  State,
  three-fifths of all the members elected to the Senate shall be necessary
  to constitute a quorum therein.
 
    d.  If, on taking the final question on a bill, it shall appear that a
  constitutional quorum is not present, or if the bill requires a vote  of
  two-thirds  of  all the Senators elected to pass it, and it appears that
  such number is not present, the bill shall retain its place on the  Cal-
  endar and be again taken up in its regular order.

    e.  When  any bill requiring the concurrence of two-thirds of the Sen-
  ators, or a quorum of three-fifths thereof, is under consideration, such
  concurrence or quorum, as the case may be, shall not be requisite except
  on the question of its final passage.
 
    f. If at any time during the session of the Senate a question shall be
  raised  by  any  Senator  as  to the presence of a quorum, the Presiding
  Officer shall forthwith direct the Secretary to call the roll, and shall
  announce the result, and such proceeding shall be without debate; but no
  Senator while speaking shall be interrupted by any other Senator raising
  the question of a lack of a quorum, and the question as to the  presence
  of  a  quorum  shall  not  be  raised more often than once in every hour
  unless the lack of a quorum shall be disclosed upon a roll call  of  the
  ayes and nays.
 
    g.  Whenever upon a roll call any Senator who is upon the floor of the
  Senate Chamber refuses to make response when his or her name is  called,
  it  shall  be  the duty of the Presiding Officer, either upon his or her
  own motion or upon the suggestion of any Senator, to request the Senator
  so remaining silent to respond to his or her name, and if  such  Senator
  fails to do so, the fact of such request and refusal shall be entered in
  the  journal,  and such Senator shall be counted as present for the pur-
  pose of constituting a quorum.
 
    § 3. Debate. a. Debate shall only be in order when it  is  germane  to
  the question under discussion.
 
    b.  If  the  question in debate contains several points, a Senator may
  have the same divided, provided the division called for embodies a  dis-
  tinct principle or statement of fact.
 
    c.  When  any bill, resolution or motion is under consideration and it
  appears that no Senator desires to be heard further, the Presiding Offi-
  cer shall put the question: "Does any Senator desire to  be  heard  fur-
  ther?"  If  no Senator shall rise to debate, the Presiding Officer shall
  declare the debate closed; except that thereafter the Conference Leaders
  may speak once, or may yield the floor to  any  Senator  who  may  speak
  once,  and may be followed by the Temporary President who may also speak
  once, or may yield the floor to any Senator who may  speak  once.    The
  main question shall then be put immediately.
 
    d.  Debate on motions or resolutions other than concurrent resolutions
  shall be limited to one and one-half hours with one-half hour  allocated
  to  each conference. Debate upon any bill or concurrent resolution shall
  be limited to four hours, which shall include sufficient  time  for  all
  Senators to explain their votes. No single Senator shall debate any bill
  or  concurrent resolution for more than thirty minutes. When any bill or
  concurrent resolution shall have been under consideration for two hours,
  including all amendments thereto, it shall be in order for  any  Senator
  to  move  to close debate, and the Presiding Officer shall recognize the
  Senator who wishes to make such motion.  Such  motion  to  close  debate
  shall not be amendable or debatable and shall be immediately put, and if
  it shall receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the Senators pre-
  sent, the pending measure shall take precedence over all other business.
 
    e.  The  vote  shall  thereupon be taken upon such bill, resolution or
  motion with such amendments as may  be  pending  at  the  time  of  such
  motion,  according  to  the  Rules  of  the  Senate, but without further

  debate, except that upon the roll call the sponsor of a bill before  the
  house  may  speak,  not to exceed five minutes, in explanation of his or
  her vote, and any Senator, including co-sponsors of the bill before  the
  house,  may speak not to exceed two minutes in explanation of his or her
  vote. After such motion to close debate has been made by any Senator, no
  other motion shall be in order until such motion has been voted upon  by
  the Senate.
 
    f.  After the Senate shall have adopted the motion to close debate, as
  hereinbefore provided, no motion shall be in order  but  one  motion  to
  adjourn  or  for  a call of the Senate by the Temporary President, and a
  motion to commit. Should said motion to adjourn be carried, the  measure
  under  consideration shall be the pending question when the Senate shall
  again convene, and shall be taken up at the point where it  was  at  the
  time of such adjournment. The motion to close debate may be ordered upon
  a  single  motion,  a series of motions allowable under the rules, or an
  amendment or amendments, or  may  be  made  to  embrace  all  authorized
  motions or amendments, and include the bill, resolution or motion to its
  passage  or  rejection.  All  incidental  questions of order, or motions
  pending at the time such motion is made to  close  debate,  whether  the
  same be on appeal or otherwise, shall be decided without debate.
 
    § 4. Order and decorum. a. Prior to the order of business, the presid-
  ing officer shall ask those in the chamber to rise and pledge allegiance
  to  the flag. Those in attendance shall remain standing during the daily
  invocation and until asked to take their seats by the presiding officer.
  Senators shall not interrupt the business of the  Senate,  or  read  any
  newspaper  while  the  journals or public papers are being read; or walk
  out of or across the Chamber when the Presiding  Officer  is  putting  a
  question; or when a Senator is speaking, pass between him or her and the
  Chair.  Cellular  telephones and audible pagers shall not be used in the
  Chamber or in the Senate Galleries. No sign, placard or  prop  shall  be
  displayed,  posted or carried in the Chamber.  Cellular telephones shall
  not be used in the lobby by members of the  general  public.  No  person
  shall be introduced by a Senator during the regular business of the Sen-
  ate,  except  that it shall be permissible to introduce a person who has
  served as a member of the New York State Legislature or a person who  is
  present  in the Chamber for the purpose of nomination to an office to be
  confirmed by the Senate. On the nomination of any person  to  an  office
  which  is subject to the confirmation of the Senate, nominating and sec-
  onding speeches shall be limited to fifteen minutes per conference.
 
    b. Members are expected to uphold the highest standards of civility in
  dealing with other members. Debate should be dignified  and  lacking  in
  personal  invective.  A  Senator rising to debate or present a paper, to
  give a notice, to make a motion or report, shall address  the  Presiding
  Officer  and shall not proceed further until recognized by the Chair; he
  or she shall speak on the same subject but twice the  same  day  without
  leave  of  the  Senate; and when two or more Senators address the Chair,
  the Presiding Officer shall name the Senator who is first  to  speak.  A
  Senator,  while  speaking  after  recognition  by  the  Chair, may, upon
  request of a Senator, yield to him or her  temporarily  without  thereby
  relinquishing  his  or her prior right to the floor and, thereafter, may
  terminate such interruption and resume speaking at any  time;  provided,
  however, that it shall not be in order for a Senator to rise and request
  that a Senator, other than the one with the right to the floor, yield to
  a  question.  Furthermore,  it shall not be in order for a Senator, with
  the right to the floor, to ask another Senator to yield to  a  question,

  unless  such Senator has previously spoken during the debate on the mat-
  ter. All questions and responses shall be directed  through  the  chair,
  and  the presiding officer shall not be interrupted when speaking. After
  completion  of the order of business for the day, and with the unanimous
  consent of the Senate, a Senator may make  a  statement,  not  exceeding
  fifteen  minutes  in  length, concerning a subject or matter not pending
  before the Senate for consideration.
 
    c. When a Senator shall be called to order, he or she shall  take  his
  or her seat until the Presiding Officer shall have determined whether he
  or  she is in order or not; and if decided to be out of order, he or she
  shall not proceed without the permission of the Senate; and every  ques-
  tion  of  order shall be decided by the Presiding Officer, subject to an
  appeal to the Senate by any Senator. It  shall  require  an  affirmative
  vote  of  a  majority of all members elected to overrule a ruling of the
  Chair. No second appeal shall be determined until  the  original  appeal
  shall  be  decided;  and if a Senator shall be called to order for words
  spoken, the words excepted to shall be immediately taken down  in  writ-
  ing.
 
    §  5.  Presentation  of  papers. a. A Senator presenting a paper shall
  endorse the same with his or her name and a brief written  statement  of
  the subject of its contents.
 
    b.  When  the  reading of a paper is called for, except petitions, and
  the same is objected to by any Senator, it shall be determined by a vote
  of the Senate, without debate.
 
    § 6. Call of the Senate. For the purpose of securing the attendance of
  Senators, a call of the Senate may be ordered at any time, but such call
  shall not be in order after the voting on any question  has  begun,  nor
  after  the  third  reading  of  a bill has been completed, nor after the
  motion to close debate has been ordered pursuant  to  section  three  of
  this  Rule, unless it shall appear upon an actual count by the Presiding
  Officer that a quorum is not present.
 
    § 7. Absences. In all cases of absence of Senators during the sessions
  of the Senate, the Temporary President or a  majority  of  the  Senators
  elected  may  take  such  measures  as they deem necessary to secure the
  presence of the absentees, and in addition to  suspension  for  a  given
  period,  may  inflict  such  censure or penalty as they may deem just on
  those who shall not render sufficient excuse for their absence.
 
    § 8. Staffing. All Senators shall receive the same base allocation  of
  funds  for  staffing  their offices. Additional funding for responsibil-
  ities associated with committees and leadership positions shall be allo-
  cated within amounts available for committee and leadership staff;  such
  amounts  shall  include,  at a minimum, a budget sufficient to appoint a
  staff member with expertise in the  committee's  subject  matter.    The
  funding  for  the  Democratic conference central staff shall not be less
  than thirty percent of the funds allocated for all central  staff  on  a
  per member basis.
 
    §  9.  Resources.  All  Senators  shall  have  equitable access to the
  resources of the Senate, including, but not limited to, office supplies,
  communications and audio visual resources, mail  privileges  subject  to
  published  guidelines, technology, including both hardware and software,

  and equal access to the Legislative Bill Drafting Commission's  Legisla-
  tive Retrieval System.
 
    §  10. District Offices. All Senators will receive funds to maintain a
  district office. Rents of district offices shall be based on a cost for-
  mula of office rental costs of an equal class of commercial office space
  based on the prevailing rent in the community where the Senator  chooses
  to  have  his  or  her  district  office.  A  Senator whose district has
  geographic disparities such that traversing the district is  a  hardship
  for  his  or  her  constituents, as determined by the Majority Coalition
  Leaders, shall receive supplemental  funding  to  maintain  a  satellite
  office.
 
    § 11. Allocation for Community Projects. Each conference shall receive
  an allocation from any amounts to be awarded by the Senate for community
  projects,  capital  spending,  local  assistance  or other similar allo-
  cations for member driven  initiatives.  The  Majority  Coalition  shall
  receive  seventy-one percent of such funds and the Democratic Conference
  shall receive twenty-nine percent of such funds; provided  however  that
  such  percentages  shall  increase or decrease to reflect any changes in
  the membership of either the Majority Coalition or the  Democratic  Con-
  ference.

  interested in pending or contemplated legislation, or who is employed by
  or receives compensation from any public or private source for influenc-
  ing legislation.
 
    i.  During  the sessions of the Senate, no person other than a Senator
  shall occupy the chair of a Senator, or stand in or otherwise occupy any
  part of the area between the last row of Senators' chairs  on  the  east
  and  west  sides  of  the  Chamber, and the east and west walls thereof,
  respectively. All persons in the Senate  Chamber  shall  observe  proper
  rules of order and decorum.
 
    j.  It  shall  be the duty of the Sergeant at Arms strictly to enforce
  the provisions of this section, and it shall be in order for any Senator
  to call a breach thereof to the attention of the Presiding Officer.

  SUSPENSION OF THE RULES
 
    Section  1.  Resolution to amend the Senate Rules. No amendment to the
  Senate Rules shall be considered by the Senate unless a  resolution  for
  such amendment, together with a memorandum specifying the purpose of the
  proposed  amendment,  suspension,  or rescission, shall be introduced to
  the Committee on Rules and  reported  therefrom  to  the  Senate  floor.
  Passing  of  any  such rules change shall require an affirmative vote of
  three-fifths of all Senators elected.
 
    § 2. Motion for Chamber Consideration. a. It shall be in order for any
  Senator, who is the sponsor of a bill that  is  on  the  Senate's  Third
  Reading  Calendar,  to move for chamber consideration of such bill. Such
  motion shall require an affirmative  vote  of  three-fifths  of  members
  elected. Where a motion for chamber consideration is approved, such bill
  shall be considered by the full Senate on the first calendar legislative
  day  after  four  days  shall  have passed. Provided however, where such
  motion is approved within the last five scheduled days  of  the  regular
  legislative  session,  such  bill  shall  be considered by the Senate no
  later than the next calendar legislative day.
 
    b. On any calendar legislative day, no more than two motions for cham-
  ber consideration shall be in order before the Senate.  The  sponsor  of

  specifying the date the motion is to be made.
 
    § 3. Petition for Consideration. a. The sponsor of any bill  may  file

  been referred to a committee, a petition requesting that  such  bill  be
  moved  to  the  calendar for consideration. Such petition shall be filed
  with the Journal Clerk. Once the petition is signed by at  least  three-
  fifths  of  the  members  elected, the petition shall be read during the
  order of presentation of petitions and the bill reported  to  the  third
  reading calendar.
 
    b.  No  petition  for  consideration shall be in order on or after the
  first Monday in June.

                                  RULE XIII

  GUIDELINES FOR A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS
 
    Section  1. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Legislative Law as enacted by
  the New York state governmental accountability, audit and internal  con-
  trol act of 1987, the following guidelines for a System of Internal Con-
  trol are hereby established:
 
    a. all financial transactions shall be executed in accordance with the
  general  or  specific authorization of the Temporary President or his or
  her designated representative;
 
    b. all financial transactions shall be  recorded  in  conformity  with
  generally  accepted  accounting  principles or other applicable criteria
  and to maintain accountability for assets;
 
    c. access to assets shall be permitted only  in  accordance  with  the
  authorization of the Temporary President or his or her designated repre-
  sentative;
 
    d.  the  recorded accountability for assets shall be compared with the
  existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action shall  be
  taken with respect to any differences; and
 
    e.  the system of internal controls shall provide reasonable assurance
  that the foregoing are accomplished.
 
    § 2. Expenditure reporting. The Temporary President shall establish  a

  scribed by the Temporary President.

                                   RULE XV
 
  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
 
    Section  1.  a.  Publication of records relating to Senate legislative
  and administrative records. Recognizing that legislative records  avail-
  able  by request under the "freedom of information law" are of important
  public interest, the Senate shall make available  through  a  searchable
  and  sortable  database  on  the  Senate website: records of committees,
  agendas, votes, minutes, reports, attendance, fiscal notes, and  records
  of  the  chamber including, active lists, votes, transcripts, calendars,
  the Senate payroll report and expenditure reports.
 
    b. Furthermore all such records  listed  in  subdivision  a  shall  be
  available  for public inspection and copying in accordance with the pro-
  visions of Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, "the freedom of  infor-
  mation law."

              PERMANENT JOINT RULES OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY
 
                                JOINT RULE I
 
    Section  1.  Requirement  of  Fiscal Impact Notes. Fiscal impact notes
  shall be required  for  all  bills  and  amendments,  other  than  those
  excepted  as  provided in section four hereof, which would substantially
  affect the revenues or expenses, or both, of  any  county,  city,  town,
  village, school district or special district (hereinafter referred to as
  "political  subdivisions").  For purposes of this Joint Rule and section
  51 of the Legislative Law, the term "special district" shall mean a dis-
  trict possessing the power to contract indebtedness and levy or  require
  the levy of taxes or benefit assessments upon real property.
 
    §  2.  Sufficiency  and Contents of Fiscal Impact Notes. Fiscal impact
  notes shall be deemed sufficient for purposes of this Joint Rule if pre-
  pared in conformity with this section.
 
    A. Scope of fiscal estimates. Fiscal impact  upon  political  subdivi-
  sions  shall be estimated on the basis of any one or more of the follow-
  ing:
 
    (i) Individual political subdivisions; or
 
    (ii) Aggregates of political subdivisions (a) statewide or  by  lesser
  geographic  area, or (b) by classification or subclassification of rele-
  vant characteristics; or
 
    (iii) Representative political subdivisions with  relevant  character-
  istics thereof quantitatively set forth, e.g., population, area, weight-
  ed average daily attendance of pupils; or
 
    (iv) Any other appropriate, convenient or accessible grouping of poli-
  tical subdivisions.
 
    B.  Units  of measurement. Fiscal impact measurements shall be made in
  units of money, personal services, equipment, or any other  appropriate,
  convenient or accessible units of measurement.
 
    C.  Negligible  Impact. A fiscal impact note filed by the sponsor of a
  bill which states that the fiscal impact of the bill is negligible shall
  be deemed to be in compliance with this Joint Rule.
 
    § 3. Procedure. A. (i) The Temporary President of the Senate  and  the
  Speaker  of the Assembly shall each designate a person in such officer's
  respective house to examine each bill in such house, without  regard  to
  its  house  of  origin, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a fiscal
  impact note is required pursuant to this Joint Rule, and if such note is
  required, such person shall so notify the sponsor of such bill.
 
    (ii) The sponsor of such bill shall provide such fiscal impact note on
  a separate form prescribed therefor by the Temporary  President  of  the
  Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly jointly.
 
    (iii)  Such  fiscal  impact note shall state the source thereof, which
  may be the sponsor; provided, however, that in the case of a  bill  pro-

  posed  by  a state department or agency, such note shall be prepared and
  furnished by such department or agency.
 
    (iv)  Such designated person in each house shall thereupon review each
  fiscal impact note for compliance with  the  provisions  of  this  Joint
  Rule.
 
    B.  No  bill  requiring  a fiscal impact note shall be reported to the
  floor of the house unless accompanied by the appropriate  note  for  the
  version  of  such  bill  so reported, except as provided in section four
  hereof.
 
    C. If an amendment to a bill has a fiscal impact, the member  offering
  such  amendment  shall  provide  the fiscal impact note required by such
  amendment. If such amendment prevails, the sponsor shall provide a  fis-
  cal  impact  note  for  the  amended  bill  before final passage, unless
  excepted pursuant to subdivision F of section four hereof.
 
    § 4. Exceptions. A fiscal impact note shall  not  be  required  for  a
  bill:
 
    A. subject to the provisions of section 50 of the Legislative Law;
 
    B. requested by a county, city, town or village in accordance with the
  provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section two of Article
  IX of the Constitution;
 
    C. which provides discretionary authority to a political subdivision;
 
    D. submitted pursuant to section 24 of the State Finance Law;
 
    E.  reported to the floor of the House by the Rules Committee, if such
  committee, in its discretion, determines that such action is in the pub-
  lic interest;
 
    F. which has been amended on the floor of either house, where a fiscal
  impact note would otherwise have been required for such amended bill  by
  this  Joint Rule and section 51 of the Legislative Law, if the Temporary
  President of the Senate or the Speaker of the Assembly, respectively, in
  such officer's discretion, determines that the amended bill may be acted
  on in such officer's house without such note; or
 
    G. which inadvertently passes the Legislature where  a  fiscal  impact
  note  would  otherwise have been required by this Joint Rule and section
  51 of the Legislative Law.
 
    § 5. Effect of Inaccuracy. If the estimate or estimates contained in a
  fiscal impact note are inaccurate, such  inaccuracy  shall  not  affect,
  impair or invalidate such bill.
 
    §  6.  Application.  The  provisions of this Joint Rule shall apply to
  bills and amendments proposed for introduction at the  nineteen  hundred
  eighty-five regular legislative session and permanently thereafter.

                                JOINT RULE II
 
    Section  1.  Committee  on  Conference. The Temporary President of the
  Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly may jointly convene a Joint  Com-
  mittee  on  Conference to consider and report upon substantially similar
  but not identical legislation that has passed each House of the Legisla-
  ture. Such committee shall be constituted by the filing of a joint  cer-
  tificate by the Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the
  Assembly with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the Assembly,
  and  shall consist of the same number of members from each House. Unless
  otherwise provided in the certificate, there shall be  five  members  on
  such  committee  from each House to be appointed by the Temporary Presi-
  dent of the Senate who shall appoint the members from the Senate and the
  Speaker of the Assembly who shall appoint the members from the Assembly;
  provided, however, that of each House's delegation at least  one  member
  shall  represent  the minority in each House. The Temporary President of
  the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly  shall  each  appoint  a  co-
  chairperson  of the committee and such co-chairpersons shall convene and
  recess meetings of the committee. Meetings jointly convened by  the  co-
  chairpersons shall be subject to the provisions of Article 7 of the Pub-
  lic  Officers  Law.  The  committee  shall file a written report setting
  forth the joint recommendations of a majority of each House's delegation
  with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the Assembly  or  such
  other  committees or officers as may be set forth in the certificate and
  such report may include specific bill language that would implement  the
  joint  committee's recommendations. No report shall be filed except upon
  the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of each House's deleg-
  ation on the committee.

                               JOINT RULE III
 
    Section  1.  Budget Consideration Schedule. In accordance with section
  54-a of the Legislative Law, within ten days of the  submission  of  the
  budget  by the Governor pursuant to article VII of the Constitution, the
  Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly  shall
  promulgate a schedule of dates for considering and acting upon such sub-
  mission.  Such  schedule  shall  include  the  dates  for  those actions
  required to be taken by the legislature pursuant to section  53  of  the
  Legislative  Law,  dates  for the convening of a joint budget conference
  committee or committees as provided herein, and a  date  by  which  such
  committee or committees shall issue a final report or reports.
 
    §  2.  Joint  Budget  Conference Committee. In accordance with section
  54-a of the Legislative Law, within ten days of the  submission  of  the
  budget  by the Governor pursuant to article VII of the Constitution, the
  Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly  shall
  jointly  establish a Joint Budget Conference Committee and, as they deem
  necessary, any number of subcommittees subordinate to such Joint  Budget
  Conference  Committee, to consider and reconcile such budget resolutions
  or bills passed by, or as may be passed by,  the  Senate  and  Assembly.
  Such  Joint  Budget  Conference  Committee shall be constituted and con-
  ducted as prescribed in Joint Rule II and shall file its written  report
  in  accord  with  the schedule established pursuant to section 1 of this
  rule.

                                JOINT RULE IV
 
    Section  1. Joint Advisory Board on Broadcast of State Government Pro-
  ceedings. The Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker  of  the
  Assembly shall convene a bi-partisan, bi-cameral joint advisory board to
  oversee  current  and future broadcast of New York State Government pro-
  ceedings. This board shall consist of eight members of whom three  shall
  be  appointed  by  the  Temporary President of the Senate, three members
  shall be appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly and one  member  shall
  be  appointed  by  each  of  the  minority  leaders of each house.   The
  appointments shall be of members of the respective houses of the  Legis-
  lature.  The  Temporary  President  of the Senate and the Speaker of the
  Assembly shall each appoint a co-chair of the board.
 
    § 2. Duties of the Joint Advisory  Board.  The  joint  advisory  board
  shall  engage  in such activities as it deems necessary for the prepara-
  tion and formulation of a report to review the efficacy of current  pro-
  gramming and explore future expansion of such to include additional leg-
  islative  and  other  governmental proceedings, as well as other related
  public policy and educational material. The report shall include specif-
  ic recommendations concerning the broadcast or webcast on  the  Internet
  of  all  legislative  committee meetings. On or before November 1, 2009,
  the report shall be submitted to the Temporary President of the  Senate,
  the  Speaker  of the Assembly, the Minority Leader of the Senate and the
  Minority Leader of the Assembly.
